## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Set the following in your production environment:
```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here

# Optional
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL="Your App <noreply@yourdomain.com>"  # Defaults to onboarding@resend.dev
```

**Setting up OpenAI:**
1. Get your API key from [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. The app uses `gpt-4o-mini` for cost-effective symptom analysis
3. Estimated cost: ~$0.0002 per symptom analysis

**Setting up Resend (Email):**
1. Get your API key from [resend.com/api-keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
2. Add and verify your domain at [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
3. For testing, you can use Resend's default: `onboarding@resend.dev`

**For local development:**
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Add your API keys
3. Run `bundle install`
