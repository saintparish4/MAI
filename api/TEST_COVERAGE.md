## Recent Fixes

### NotificationService Test Fixes
**Issue:** Password validation errors in notification preference tests  
**Solution:** Added explicit password and password_confirmation setting before saving patient records  
**Files Modified:** `spec/services/notification_service_spec.rb`  
**Result:** All 25 tests now passing ✅

**Technical Details:**
- Tests were failing because modifying notification preferences triggered password validation
- Fixed by explicitly setting `password` and `password_confirmation` before `save!` calls
- Ensures password meets minimum 6-character requirement during test execution
